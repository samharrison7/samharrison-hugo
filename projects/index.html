                        December 2023 to December 2024
                    
                    In this Defra-funded project, we are seeking to evaluate and cost the environmental and economic impact of various mitigation options to prevent pollution from intentionally added microplastics. I am leading aspects on the assessment of environmental emissions and exposure.

                    The goal of EMIFACT-MNP is to develop a model of Micro and Nanoplastic EMIssion FACTors in Europe. Quantifying emissions of plastics to the environment is crucial to be able to make accurate fate and exposure predictions. In this project, we are using probabilistic material flow analysis approaches alongside knowledge on microplastic degradation and fragmentation, to be able to predict size-distributed emissions of a broad range of polymers across their whole lifecycle."><meta name=keywords content="environmental scientist,environmental modelling,research software,blog"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://samharrison.science/images/sam.jpg"><meta name=twitter:title content="My Projects"><meta name=twitter:description content="Projects that I am currently or have previously been involved in.

The model is a pragmatic, open-source tool to allow stakeholders to predict how a broad variety of polymers fragment under environmentally realistic ranges of degradation (e.g. photolysis, hydrolysis and biodegradation) and mechanical stresses. Understanding fragmentation is crucial in risk assessing plastics, due to the differential uptake and transport of different sized plastic particles.</p><div class=meta><span class=item><i class="fa fa-fw fa-newspaper-o"></i><a href=/publications/fragment-mnp>Related outputs</a></span>

The so-called <a href=https://github.com/nerc-ceh/nanofase target=_blank>NanoFASE model</a> (Nanomaterial Fate And Speciation in the Environment) represents not only the state-of-the-art in nanomaterial exposure modelling, but alse one of the more advanced exposure models in existence, offering predictions of nanomaterial concentrations with spatiotemporal resolution across terrestrial and aquatic environments. The project finished in 2019, but we are continuing to develop the model in other nano-related projects, as well as extending its domain to other chemicals.</p><div class=meta><span class=item><i class="fa fa-fw fa-newspaper-o"></i><a href=/publications/nanofase>Related outputs</a></span>
