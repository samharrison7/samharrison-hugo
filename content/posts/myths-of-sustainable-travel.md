Those of you that know me will know that I do my best to avoid flying, both for work and personal trips. I have an unofficial rule that, if I can reach somewhere within two days overland, then I don't fly. This means that most European destinations are within my no-fly zone, with only the far reaches of eastern Europe being unachievable in two days.

I made this decision due to the damaging environmental impact of aviation. I was already vegetarian, trending towards vegan, and was surprised to learn that the reduction in greenhouse gas footprint of going vegan for a full year (around 0.8 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq) would be far outstripped by taking just one long haul flight (e.g. a London to Bangkok return flight contributes around 3.2 toones CO<sub>2</sub>-eq). Indeed, one long haul flight has a larger environmental footprint than the IPCC's recommend annual sustainable footprint of 2.3 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq per person [1].
