Hi :wave:, I'm Sam - an environmental modeller and self-proclaimed research software engineer at the [UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://ceh.ac.uk), Lancaster, with a background in quantum physics and software development. My main specialism is in the development of geospatial fate and exposure models of potential pollutants in soils and surface waters, including micro- and nanoplastics, nanomaterials and metals. Through this, I am interested in integrating models to better quantify the impact of environmental change, giving us a deeper understanding of human-environment interactions. My work frequently involves assessing the relevance of such models to regulators and industry, tackling issues around how complex model output can be best used in robust, evidence-based decision making. I currently lead the [FRAGMENT-MNP](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/fragment-mnp) project, which is developing a model of micro- and nanoplastic fragmentation in the environment.

I am a keen advocate of, [creator of and contributor to](https://github.com/samharrison7) open source software and open science. I am a 2022 Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk) and am interested in how software sustainability best practices and state-of-the-art digital infrastructures can help environmental modelling. I am an early career fellow on NERC's [Constructing a Digital Environment Expert Network](https://digitalenvironment.org) and a member of the [Centre of Excellence in Environmental Data Science](https://ceeds.ac.uk) (CEEDS).

In my free time, I can usually be found running, walking, climbing or cycling in the hills and mountains of the UK. I am a qualified winter mountain leader and have previously worked as a freelance outdoor instructor.

## My Projects

{{< project title="FRAGMENT-MNP"
    dates="October 2021 to September 2023"
    website="https://ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/fragment-mnp"

    demo="http://fragmentmnp.samharrison.science" >}}
I am currently leading this project, funded by the European Chemicals Industry Council's Long-Range Research Initiative (Cefic-LRI), to develop a mechanistic model of micro- and nanoplastic fragmentation in the environment. The model will be a pragmatic, open-source tool to allow stakeholders to predict how a broad variety of polymers fragment under environmentally realistic ranges of degradation (e.g. photolysis, hydrolysis and biodegradation) and mechanical stresses. Understanding fragmentation is crucial in risk assessing plastics, due to the differential uptake and transport of different sized plastic particles.

{{< project title="Nanomaterial Safe(r)-by-Design projects"
    dates="March 2020 to February 2024" >}}
The [SAbyNA](https://sabyna.eu) and [ASINA](https://www.asina-project.eu/) projects are aiming to facilitate safe-by-design nanomaterial development. In these projects, I lead on assessing what safe-by-design means for environmental exposure assessment, and how currently available environmental exposure models can be used and optimised for safe-by-design purposes.

{{< project title="NanoFASE"
    dates="August 2015 to September 2019"
    website="http://nanofase.eu"
    repo="https://github.com/nerc-ceh/nanofase"
    img="nanofase.png" >}}
The goal of this â‚¬11m European Commission Horizon 2020 project was to develop an exposure assessment framework for engineered nanomaterials. Central to this was the creation of a multimedia spatiotemporal model of nanomaterial fate and speciation in the environment, which I was responsible for developing. The so-called [NanoFASE model](https://github.com/nerc-ceh/nanofase) (Nanomaterial Fate And Speciation in the Environment) represents not only the state-of-the-art in nanomaterial exposure modelling, but alse one of the more advanced exposure models in existence, offering predictions of nanomaterial concentrations with spatiotemporal resolution across terrestrial and aquatic environments. The project finished in 2019, but we are continuing to develop the model in other nano-related projects, as well as extending its domain to other chemicals.
