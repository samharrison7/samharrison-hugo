Hi :wave:, I'm Sam - an environmental modeller and self-proclaimed research software engineer at the [UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://ceh.ac.uk), Lancaster, with a background in quantum physics and software development. My main specialism is in the development of geospatial fate and exposure models of potential pollutants in soils and surface waters, including micro- and nanoplastics, nanomaterials and metals. Through this, I am interested in integrating models to better quantify the impact of environmental change, giving us a deeper understanding of human-environment interactions. My work frequently involves assessing the relevance of such models to regulators and industry, tackling issues around how complex model output can be best used in robust, evidence-based decision making. I currently lead the [FRAGMENT-MNP](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/fragment-mnp) project, which is developing a model of micro- and nanoplastic fragmentation in the environment.

I am a keen advocate of, [creator of and contributor to](https://github.com/samharrison7) open source software and open science. I am a 2022 Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk) and am interested in how software sustainability best practices and state-of-the-art digital infrastructures can help environmental modelling. I am an early career fellow on NERC's [Constructing a Digital Environment Expert Network](https://digitalenvironment.org) and a member of the [Centre of Excellence in Environmental Data Science](https://ceeds.ac.uk) (CEEDS).

In my free time, I can usually be found running, walking, climbing or cycling in the hills and mountains of the UK. I am a qualified winter mountain leader and have previously worked as a freelance outdoor instructor.
