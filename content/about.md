### How this site was built

This website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and lovingly adapted from the [Coder theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/). On top of these, I use [nb2hugo](https://github.com/vlunot/nb2hugo) to convert Jupyter Notebooks to a Markdown format supported by Hugo. I use Jupyter Notebooks to write blog articles that contain a lot of code, to make sure bugs are kept to a minimum (because I can test the code prior to converting to Markdown).
