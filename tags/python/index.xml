As Conda packages distribute compiled binaries, rather than your source code, they are not limited to specific programming languages (e.g. unlike Python packages distributed via PyPI). This makes them particularly suited to complex projects that might use a selection of different languages.
One common paradigm in scientific computing is the combined use of Fortran and Python.</description></item><item><title>How to compare two empirical distributions</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/how-to-compare-two-distributions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/how-to-compare-two-distributions/</guid><description>The world is full of distributions - people&amp;rsquo;s height, incomes, exam results, average temperatures, heights of trees, sizes of microplastic particles in the environment. It stands to reason that there will be times when we need to compare these distributions to see how similar (or different) they are. For example, were summer temperatures similar this year to last year? Do two groups of people who buy different products make similar incomes?</description></item></channel></rss>
