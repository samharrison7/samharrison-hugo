It stands to reason that there will be times when we need to compare these distributions to see how similar (or different) they are. For example, were summer temperatures similar this year to last year? Do two groups of people who buy different products make similar incomes? Do modelled size distributions of microplastics match what we expect from observations?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
