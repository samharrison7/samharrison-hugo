Though the main point of the post was to explore including Fortran code in Python, I also delved into Conda build as a way of building Conda packages. There is now a new kid on the block - &lt;a href="https://prefix-dev.github.io/rattler-build/latest/" target="_blank">rattler-build&lt;/a> - which offers a much faster and cleaner build experience for building Conda packages. I thought it was time for a blog post on that.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
