  I am currently leading this project, funded by the European Chemical
  Industry Councilâ€™s Long-Range Research Initiative (Cefic-LRI), to develop
  a mechanistic model of micro- and nanoplastic fragmentation in the
  environment. The model will be a pragmatic, open-source tool to allow
  stakeholders to predict how a broad variety of polymers fragment under
  environmentally realistic ranges of degradation (e.g. photolysis,
  hydrolysis and biodegradation) and mechanical stresses. Understanding
  fragmentation is crucial in risk assessing plastics, due to the differential
  uptake and transport of different sized plastic particles.
