  As part of the UK Status, Change and Projections of the Environment (UK-SCAPE) project,
  SPEED aims to produce spatially-explicit projections of how key environmental drivers
  are predicted to change under differing social and climatic futures. Using these projections,
  we are predicting future topsoil metal concentrations, bioaccumulation and risk, by
  developing an integrated model of soil carbon, pH and metal speciation.
