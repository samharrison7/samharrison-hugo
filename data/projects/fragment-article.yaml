description: >-
  In this project, we are further developing the FRAGMENT-MNP
  model to be able to model the degradation and fragmentation
  of plastic articles with different formulations. Our partners,
  Fraunhofer IME and BASF, will undertake degradation experiments
  in soils and ocean water, and these data will enable us to
  parameterise the FRAGMENT-MNP model to predict fragmentation
  under environmentally realistic conditions.
