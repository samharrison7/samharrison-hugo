  The aim of this EU Horizon Europe project is to reduce the environmental
  impact of pharmaceutical products throughout their life cycle. Our work
  is to assess the environmental risk posed by commonly used pharmaceuticals,
  including how product and process modifications investigated in the project will
  reduce this risk.
