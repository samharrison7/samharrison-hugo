  The goal of this â‚¬11m European Commission Horizon 2020 project was to develop an exposure
  assessment framework for engineered nanomaterials. Central to this was the creation of a
  multimedia spatiotemporal model of nanomaterial fate and speciation in the environment,
  which I was responsible for developing. The so-called [NanoFASE model](https://github.com/nerc-ceh/nanofase)
  (Nanomaterial Fate And Speciation in the Environment) represents not only the state-of-the-art
  in nanomaterial exposure modelling, but alse one of the more advanced exposure models in
  existence, offering predictions of nanomaterial concentrations with spatiotemporal resolution
  across terrestrial and aquatic environments. The project finished in 2019, but we are continuing
  to develop the model in other nano-related projects, as well as extending its domain to other chemicals.
