  The [SAbyNA](https://sabyna.eu) and [ASINA](https://www.asina-project.eu/) projects are
  aiming to facilitate safe-by-design nanomaterial development. In these projects, I assess
  what safe-by-design means for environmental exposure assessment, and how
  currently available environmental exposure models can be used and optimised for safe-by-design purposes.
