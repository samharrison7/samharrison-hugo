  The DEPICTION project is developing in international community of practice
  to advance open and FAIR environmental modelling. I lead the project, which is funded
  by NERC's Global Partnerships Seedcorn Fund and is a new collaboration
  between UKCEH, CSDMS (University of Colorado Boulder), the Netherlands eScience Center,
  TU Delft, Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts
  Dartmouth. The strength offered by this united international community
  of software tools, standards and practices will be showcased through a case study
  of source-to-sea microplastic fate, coupling together existing hydrological,
  chemical fate and coastal ocean models.
