  The goal of EMIFACT-MNP is to develop a model of Micro and Nanoplastic
  EMIssion FACTors in Europe. Quantifying emissions of plastics to the
  environment is crucial to be able to make accurate fate and exposure
  predictions. In this project, we are using probabilistic material flow
  analysis approaches alongside knowledge on microplastic degradation and
  fragmentation, to be able to predict size-distributed emissions of
  a broad range of polymers across their whole lifecycle.
