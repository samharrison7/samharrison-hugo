Though the main point of the post was to explore including Fortran code in Python, I also delved into Conda build as a way of building Conda packages. There is now a new kid on the block - &lt;a href="https://prefix-dev.github.io/rattler-build/latest/" target="_blank">rattler-build&lt;/a> - which offers a much faster and cleaner build experience for building Conda packages. I thought it was time for a blog post on that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scheduling a Python script using PythonAnywhere and cron-job.org</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/scheduling-python-scripts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 10:07:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/scheduling-python-scripts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Scheduling a script is one of those jobs that sounds like it should be easy, but is surprisingly tricky. Here, I walk you through one of the easier ways of doing so, by hosting the script on &lt;a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">PythonAnywhere&lt;/a> to give it a URL, and scheduling it to run using &lt;a href="https://cron-job.org" target="_blank">cron-job.org&lt;/a>, both of which offer free services.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Scheduling scripts is when, instead of manually running a script whenever you need to, you tell a scheduler to run it at a given frequency or based on other events. There are many uses, such as running a forecasting model to provide regular forecasts, or pulling in the latest observations data to parameterise that model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting more out of your Tado heating system with Python and the Tado API</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/tado-heating-python-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/tado-heating-python-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have recently installed a Tado thermostat to control our heating system. Tado is a &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; heating system, in the sense that it is internet connected and lets you control your heating via its own app. The app is surprisingly good, but lacking in a few places, and so this got me wondering whether Tado had an API, and whether I could leverage this to get a bit more out of our heating system.

The same old, already-disproven arguments are being dragged to the surface for a last breath of air: theyâ€™re worse for the environment because of battery manufacturing and power generation (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/electric-vehicle-myths" target="_blank">not true&lt;/a>), theyâ€™re more likely to spontaneously catch fire (quite the opposite, and &lt;a href="https://thedriven.io/2023/05/16/petrol-and-diesel-cars-20-times-more-likely-to-catch-fire-than-evs/" target="_blank">by a significant margin&lt;/a>) and that inadequate charging infrastructure and low ranges make them a practical nightmare for anything but popping to the local supermarket.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a Conda package for a project with Fortran and Python code</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/conda-package-fortran-python/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 16:02:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/conda-package-fortran-python/</guid><description>&lt;p>Creating a Conda package is a great way to package and distribute your projectâ€™s software and its dependencies in a platform- and language-agnostic way. As Conda packages distribute compiled binaries, rather than your source code, they are not limited to specific programming languages (e.g. unlike Python packages distributed via PyPI). This makes them particularly suited to complex projects that might use a selection of different languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One common paradigm in scientific computing is the combined use of Fortran and Python. Fortran is often used for underlying models and algorithms that are computationally intensive, whilst the plethora of data processing packages available in Python are leveraged to provide advanced data parsing and visualisation capabilities. This is a paradigm I often use in my own work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Publications: DEPICTION</title><link>https://samharrison.science/publications/depiction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 15:51:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/publications/depiction/</guid><description>&lt;p>Publications relating to the DEPICTION project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Microplastics2022 conference wrap-up</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/microplastics2022-wrap-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 11:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/microplastics2022-wrap-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sitting on the TGV from Zurich to Paris, returning from an exciting and educational week spent at the &lt;a href="https://microplastics2022.ch/" target="_blank">Microplastics2022 conference&lt;/a> in Monte VeritÃ  in Switzerland, I thought I should jot down some scattered thoughts on the conference.

&lt;p>And then I thought these thoughts might just about be useful enough to others to warrant publishing, and so here is a brief post along those lines.

We will use Jupyter to create a simple notebook that plots a graph based on user input, turn this into an interactive dashboard using VoilÃ , and host it online using Heroku.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we get started, there are a few prerequisites:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I am presuming that you already have Jupyter installed and are familiar with using it and Python in general.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am also presuming you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Git and package managers Conda and Pip. Having Git and Conda installed is needed to follow all of the steps.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are using ipywidgets to provide the interactivity, so familiarity with these would be useful.&lt;/li>

It stands to reason that there will be times when we need to compare these distributions to see how similar (or different) they are. For example, were summer temperatures similar this year to last year? Do two groups of people who buy different products make similar incomes? Do modelled size distributions of microplastics match what we expect from observations?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 16:24:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey - welcome to my site!

 &lt;span class="dates">January 2023 to December 2024&lt;/span>
 
 &lt;p>The goal of EMIFACT-MNP is to develop a model of Micro and Nanoplastic EMIssion FACTors in Europe. Quantifying emissions of plastics to the environment is crucial to be able to make accurate fate and exposure predictions. In this project, we are using probabilistic material flow analysis approaches alongside knowledge on microplastic degradation and fragmentation, to be able to predict size-distributed emissions of a broad range of polymers across their whole lifecycle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Research</title><link>https://samharrison.science/my-research/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 17:58:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/my-research/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi &amp;#x1f44b;, I&amp;rsquo;m Sam - an environmental modeller and self-proclaimed research software engineer at the &lt;a href="https://ceh.ac.uk" target="_blank">UK Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology&lt;/a>, Lancaster, with a background in quantum physics and software development. My main specialism is in the development of geospatial fate and exposure models of potential pollutants in soils and surface waters, including micro- and nanoplastics, nanomaterials and metals. Through this, I am interested in integrating models to better quantify the impact of environmental change, giving us a deeper understanding of human-environment interactions. My work frequently involves assessing the relevance of such models to regulators and industry, tackling issues around how complex model output can be best used in robust, evidence-based decision making. Amongst other things, I currently lead the &lt;a href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/fragment-mnp" target="_blank">FRAGMENT-MNP&lt;/a> and EMIFACT-MNP projects, which are developing models of micro- and nanoplastic fragmentation and emissions in the environment. I also lead a work package on envionmental risk in the Horizon Europe project ETERNAL, in which we are aiming to make pharmaceuticals more environmentally sustainable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://samharrison.science/contact/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/contact/</guid><description>&lt;p>Got a question, an idea, a comment or just want to chat?
