Things I learnt, themes I saw emerging, new science appearing and old science being adapted.
And then I thought these thoughts might just about be useful enough to others to warrant publishing, and so here is a brief post along those lines.</description></item><item><title>Create and hosting an interactive app with Jupyter, VoilÃ  and Heroku</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/interactive-app-jupyter-voila-heroku/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 09:17:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/interactive-app-jupyter-voila-heroku/</guid><description>In this article, I will demonstrate how easy it is to create an interactive web app using Jupyter Notebooks, VoilÃ  and Heroku. We will use Jupyter to create a simple notebook that plots a graph based on user input, turn this into an interactive dashboard using VoilÃ , and host it online using Heroku.
Before we get started, there are a few prerequisites:
I am presuming that you already have Jupyter installed and are familiar with using it and Python in general.</description></item><item><title>How to compare two empirical distributions</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/how-to-compare-two-distributions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/how-to-compare-two-distributions/</guid><description>The world is full of distributions - people&amp;rsquo;s height, incomes, exam results, average temperatures, heights of trees, sizes of microplastic particles in the environment. It stands to reason that there will be times when we need to compare these distributions to see how similar (or different) they are. For example, were summer temperatures similar this year to last year? Do two groups of people who buy different products make similar incomes?</description></item><item><title>Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</title><link>https://samharrison.science/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 16:24:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/posts/welcome/</guid><description>Hey - welcome to my site! This is just a little post to say hello and because no blog would be complete without a &amp;ldquo;this is my first post&amp;rdquo; post.
In the future, this blog will be adorned with lots of useful tidbits about all things software, the environment, and environmental software. In the meantime, why not:

On top of these, I use nb2hugo to convert Jupyter Notebooks to a Markdown format supported by Hugo. I use Jupyter Notebooks to write blog articles that contain a lot of code, to make sure bugs are kept to a minimum (because I can test the code prior to converting to Markdown).</description></item><item><title>Publications: ETERNAL</title><link>https://samharrison.science/publications/eternal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/publications/eternal/</guid><description>Publications relating to the ETERNAL project.</description></item><item><title>Publications: FRAGMENT-MNP</title><link>https://samharrison.science/publications/fragment-mnp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/publications/fragment-mnp/</guid><description>Publications relating to the FRAGMENT-MNP project and model.</description></item><item><title>Publications: NanoFASE</title><link>https://samharrison.science/publications/nanofase/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/publications/nanofase/</guid><description>Publications relating to the NanoFASE project and model.</description></item><item><title>Publications: NanoSolveIT</title><link>https://samharrison.science/publications/nanosolveit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/publications/nanosolveit/</guid><description>Publications relating to the NanoSolveIT project.</description></item><item><title>Publications: SAbyNA and ASINA</title><link>https://samharrison.science/publications/sabyna_asina/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/publications/sabyna_asina/</guid><description>Publications relating to the SAbyNA and ASINA projects.</description></item><item><title>Publications: UKSCAPE SPEED</title><link>https://samharrison.science/publications/speed/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/publications/speed/</guid><description>Publications relating to the UK-SCAPE SPEED project.</description></item><item><title>My Projects</title><link>https://samharrison.science/projects/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 17:58:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/projects/</guid><description>Projects that I am currently or have previously been involved in.
DEPICTION October 2022 to September 2025 The DEPICTION project is developing in international community of practice to advance open and FAIR environmental modelling. I lead the project, which is funded by NERC&amp;rsquo;s Global Partnerships Seedcorn Fund and is a new collaboration between UKCEH, CSDMS (University of Colorado Boulder), the Netherlands eScience Center, TU Delft, Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.</description></item><item><title>My Research</title><link>https://samharrison.science/my-research/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 17:58:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/my-research/</guid><description>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I&amp;rsquo;m Sam - an environmental modeller and self-proclaimed research software engineer at the UK Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology, Lancaster, with a background in quantum physics and software development. My main specialism is in the development of geospatial fate and exposure models of potential pollutants in soils and surface waters, including micro- and nanoplastics, nanomaterials and metals. Through this, I am interested in integrating models to better quantify the impact of environmental change, giving us a deeper understanding of human-environment interactions.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://samharrison.science/contact/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 17:57:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samharrison.science/contact/</guid><description>Got a question, an idea, a comment or just want to chat?
